# IRPopt model

This project contains the IRPopt model.

Given the complexity at the municipal level (e.g., technological progress, actor base, regulatory framework, and the market environment), energy system interdependencies between different alternatives need to be considered to systematically develop sustainable future systems. One possibility to support decision-makers is to apply optimization models. Due to the increasing decentralization of energy systems, it is especially necessary to find business models that provide an opportunity for different market actors, such as municipal utilities and residential prosumers.

IRPopt (Integrated Resource Planning and Optimization) represents an integrated techno-economic optimization that integrates the roles different actors play and the resulting impact they have. A proven graph-based energy system approach allows the accurate modelling of deployment systems by considering different energy carriers and technical processes. In addition, a graph-based commercial association approach enables the integration of actor-oriented coordination. This is achieved by the explicit modelling of municipal market actors on one layer and technology processes on another layer as well as resource flow interrelations and commercial agreements mechanism among and between the different layers. Using the optimization framework, various integrated optimization problems are solvable based on a generic objective function. In this context, the web-based software also allows assessing different scenarios concerning technological progress and regulatory framework.
